# Reels-Kro

It is a React application where user can upload reels video,like and comment on reels in feed.It has all the features of authentication and autherization where a user has to login first to see others reels and like and comment on them.

Application all has features of autoplay and pause features and smooth scrool features.I have used Interscetion Observer API to implement this features.

Firebase is used at the backend to provide authentication and autherization. And Firestore and Firesbase are used for database
